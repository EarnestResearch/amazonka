-- | Creates a value of 'StartJobRun' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sjrNumberOfWorkers' - The number of workers of a defined @workerType@ that are allocated when a job runs. The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for @G.1X@ , and 149 for @G.2X@ . 
--
-- * 'sjrNotificationProperty' - Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.
--
-- * 'sjrArguments' - The job arguments specifically for this run. For this job run, they replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself. You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes. For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python> topic in the developer guide. For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue> topic in the developer guide.
--
-- * 'sjrWorkerType' - The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.     * For the @Standard@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.     * For the @G.1X@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.     * For the @G.2X@ worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
--
-- * 'sjrSecurityConfiguration' - The name of the @SecurityConfiguration@ structure to be used with this job run.
--
-- * 'sjrAllocatedCapacity' - This field is deprecated. Use @MaxCapacity@ instead. The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/ AWS Glue pricing page> .
--
-- * 'sjrMaxCapacity' - The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/ AWS Glue pricing page> . Do not set @Max Capacity@ if using @WorkerType@ and @NumberOfWorkers@ . The value that can be allocated for @MaxCapacity@ depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, or an Apache Spark ETL job:     * When you specify a Python shell job (@JobCommand.Name@ ="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.     * When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (@JobCommand.Name@ ="glueetl"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.
--
-- * 'sjrTimeout' - The @JobRun@ timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters @TIMEOUT@ status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.
--
-- * 'sjrJobRunId' - The ID of a previous @JobRun@ to retry.
--
-- * 'sjrJobName' - The name of the job definition to use.
