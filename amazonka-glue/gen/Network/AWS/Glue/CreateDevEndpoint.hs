-- | Creates a value of 'CreateDevEndpoint' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cdeNumberOfWorkers' - The number of workers of a defined @workerType@ that are allocated to the development endpoint. The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for @G.1X@ , and 149 for @G.2X@ . 
--
-- * 'cdeExtraPythonLibsS3Path' - The paths to one or more Python libraries in an Amazon S3 bucket that should be loaded in your @DevEndpoint@ . Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.
--
-- * 'cdeSecurityGroupIds' - Security group IDs for the security groups to be used by the new @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdePublicKeys' - A list of public keys to be used by the development endpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.
--
-- * 'cdeArguments' - A map of arguments used to configure the @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdeWorkerType' - The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the development endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.     * For the @Standard@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.     * For the @G.1X@ worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.     * For the @G.2X@ worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs. Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with the @G.2X@ @WorkerType@ configuration, the Spark drivers for the development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk. 
--
-- * 'cdeSecurityConfiguration' - The name of the @SecurityConfiguration@ structure to be used with this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdePublicKey' - The public key to be used by this @DevEndpoint@ for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.
--
-- * 'cdeSubnetId' - The subnet ID for the new @DevEndpoint@ to use.
--
-- * 'cdeGlueVersion' - Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that AWS Glue supports. The Python version indicates the version supported for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints.  For more information about the available AWS Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html Glue version> in the developer guide. Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9. You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the @Arguments@ parameter in the @CreateDevEndpoint@ or @UpdateDevEndpoint@ APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
--
-- * 'cdeNumberOfNodes' - The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdeExtraJARsS3Path' - The path to one or more Java @.jar@ files in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdeTags' - The tags to use with this DevEndpoint. You may use tags to limit access to the DevEndpoint. For more information about tags in AWS Glue, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-tags.html AWS Tags in AWS Glue> in the developer guide.
--
-- * 'cdeEndpointName' - The name to be assigned to the new @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'cdeRoleARN' - The IAM role for the @DevEndpoint@ .
