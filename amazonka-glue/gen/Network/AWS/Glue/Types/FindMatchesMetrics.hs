-- | The evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm. The quality of your machine learning transform is measured by getting your transform to predict some matches and comparing the results to known matches from the same dataset. The quality metrics are based on a subset of your data, so they are not precise.

-- | Creates a value of 'FindMatchesMetrics' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fmmF1' - The maximum F1 metric indicates the transform's accuracy between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy. For more information, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score F1 score> in Wikipedia.
--
-- * 'fmmAreaUnderPRCurve' - The area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a single number measuring the overall quality of the transform, that is independent of the choice made for precision vs. recall. Higher values indicate that you have a more attractive precision vs. recall tradeoff. For more information, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall Precision and recall> in Wikipedia.
--
-- * 'fmmRecall' - The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your transform predicts the match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total records in the source data. For more information, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall Precision and recall> in Wikipedia.
--
-- * 'fmmPrecision' - The precision metric indicates when often your transform is correct when it predicts a match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total true positives possible. For more information, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall Precision and recall> in Wikipedia.
--
-- * 'fmmConfusionMatrix' - The confusion matrix shows you what your transform is predicting accurately and what types of errors it is making. For more information, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix Confusion matrix> in Wikipedia.
