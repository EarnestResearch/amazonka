-- | Creates a value of 'DevEndpoint' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'deStatus' - The current status of this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deFailureReason' - The reason for a current failure in this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deEndpointName' - The name of the @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deNumberOfWorkers' - The number of workers of a defined @workerType@ that are allocated to the development endpoint. The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for @G.1X@ , and 149 for @G.2X@ . 
--
-- * 'deExtraPythonLibsS3Path' - The paths to one or more Python libraries in an Amazon S3 bucket that should be loaded in your @DevEndpoint@ . Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.
--
-- * 'deLastUpdateStatus' - The status of the last update.
--
-- * 'deSecurityGroupIds' - A list of security group identifiers used in this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deLastModifiedTimestamp' - The point in time at which this @DevEndpoint@ was last modified.
--
-- * 'dePublicKeys' - A list of public keys to be used by the @DevEndpoints@ for authentication. Using this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.
--
-- * 'deVPCId' - The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) used by this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deArguments' - A map of arguments used to configure the @DevEndpoint@ . Valid arguments are:     * @"--enable-glue-datacatalog": ""@      * @"GLUE_PYTHON_VERSION": "3"@      * @"GLUE_PYTHON_VERSION": "2"@  You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the @Arguments@ parameter in the @CreateDevEndpoint@ or @UpdateDevEndpoint@ APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
--
-- * 'dePrivateAddress' - A private IP address to access the @DevEndpoint@ within a VPC if the @DevEndpoint@ is created within one. The @PrivateAddress@ field is present only when you create the @DevEndpoint@ within your VPC.
--
-- * 'deWorkerType' - The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the development endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.     * For the @Standard@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.     * For the @G.1X@ worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.     * For the @G.2X@ worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs. Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with the @G.2X@ @WorkerType@ configuration, the Spark drivers for the development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk. 
--
-- * 'deSecurityConfiguration' - The name of the @SecurityConfiguration@ structure to be used with this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'dePublicKey' - The public key to be used by this @DevEndpoint@ for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.
--
-- * 'deSubnetId' - The subnet ID for this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deGlueVersion' - Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that AWS Glue supports. The Python version indicates the version supported for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints.  For more information about the available AWS Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html Glue version> in the developer guide. Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9. You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the @Arguments@ parameter in the @CreateDevEndpoint@ or @UpdateDevEndpoint@ APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
--
-- * 'deNumberOfNodes' - The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) allocated to this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'dePublicAddress' - The public IP address used by this @DevEndpoint@ . The @PublicAddress@ field is present only when you create a non-virtual private cloud (VPC) @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deAvailabilityZone' - The AWS Availability Zone where this @DevEndpoint@ is located.
--
-- * 'deZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort' - The Apache Zeppelin port for the remote Apache Spark interpreter.
--
-- * 'deExtraJARsS3Path' - The path to one or more Java @.jar@ files in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deCreatedTimestamp' - The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was created.
--
-- * 'deYarnEndpointAddress' - The YARN endpoint address used by this @DevEndpoint@ .
--
-- * 'deRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used in this @DevEndpoint@ .
