-- | Creates a value of 'Trigger' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'triWorkflowName' - The name of the workflow associated with the trigger.
--
-- * 'triState' - The current state of the trigger.
--
-- * 'triActions' - The actions initiated by this trigger.
--
-- * 'triSchedule' - A @cron@ expression used to specify the schedule (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-data-warehouse-schedule.html Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers> . For example, to run something every day at 12:15 UTC, you would specify: @cron(15 12 * * ? *)@ .
--
-- * 'triPredicate' - The predicate of this trigger, which defines when it will fire.
--
-- * 'triName' - The name of the trigger.
--
-- * 'triId' - Reserved for future use.
--
-- * 'triType' - The type of trigger that this is.
--
-- * 'triDescription' - A description of this trigger.
