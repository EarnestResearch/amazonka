-- | Creates a value of 'Condition' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCrawlState' - The state of the crawler to which this condition applies.
--
-- * 'cState' - The condition state. Currently, the values supported are @SUCCEEDED@ , @STOPPED@ , @TIMEOUT@ , and @FAILED@ .

-- * 'cJobName' - The name of the job whose @JobRuns@ this condition applies to, and on which this trigger waits.
--
-- * 'cLogicalOperator' - A logical operator.

-- * 'cCrawlerName' - The name of the crawler to which this condition applies.
