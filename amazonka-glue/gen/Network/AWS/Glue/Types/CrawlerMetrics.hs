-- | Creates a value of 'CrawlerMetrics' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmLastRuntimeSeconds' - The duration of the crawler's most recent run, in seconds.
--
-- * 'cmTablesCreated' - The number of tables created by this crawler.
--
-- * 'cmStillEstimating' - True if the crawler is still estimating how long it will take to complete this run.
--
-- * 'cmMedianRuntimeSeconds' - The median duration of this crawler's runs, in seconds.
--
-- * 'cmTimeLeftSeconds' - The estimated time left to complete a running crawl.
--
-- * 'cmTablesDeleted' - The number of tables deleted by this crawler.
--
-- * 'cmTablesUpdated' - The number of tables updated by this crawler.
--
-- * 'cmCrawlerName' - The name of the crawler.
