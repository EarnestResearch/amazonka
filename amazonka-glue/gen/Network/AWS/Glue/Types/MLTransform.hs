-- | Creates a value of 'MLTransform' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mltStatus' - The current status of the machine learning transform.
--
-- * 'mltNumberOfWorkers' - The number of workers of a defined @workerType@ that are allocated when a task of the transform runs. If @WorkerType@ is set, then @NumberOfWorkers@ is required (and vice versa).
--
-- * 'mltLastModifiedOn' - A timestamp. The last point in time when this machine learning transform was modified.
--
-- * 'mltLabelCount' - A count identifier for the labeling files generated by AWS Glue for this transform. As you create a better transform, you can iteratively download, label, and upload the labeling file.
--
-- * 'mltWorkerType' - The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a task of this transform runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.     * For the @Standard@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.     * For the @G.1X@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.     * For the @G.2X@ worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker. @MaxCapacity@ is a mutually exclusive option with @NumberOfWorkers@ and @WorkerType@ .     * If either @NumberOfWorkers@ or @WorkerType@ is set, then @MaxCapacity@ cannot be set.     * If @MaxCapacity@ is set then neither @NumberOfWorkers@ or @WorkerType@ can be set.     * If @WorkerType@ is set, then @NumberOfWorkers@ is required (and vice versa).     * @MaxCapacity@ and @NumberOfWorkers@ must both be at least 1.
--
-- * 'mltInputRecordTables' - A list of AWS Glue table definitions used by the transform.
--
-- * 'mltGlueVersion' - This value determines which version of AWS Glue this machine learning transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most customers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/release-notes.html#release-notes-versions AWS Glue Versions> in the developer guide.
--
-- * 'mltEvaluationMetrics' - An @EvaluationMetrics@ object. Evaluation metrics provide an estimate of the quality of your machine learning transform.
--
-- * 'mltSchema' - A map of key-value pairs representing the columns and data types that this transform can run against. Has an upper bound of 100 columns.
--
-- * 'mltRole' - The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the required permissions. The required permissions include both AWS Glue service role permissions to AWS Glue resources, and Amazon S3 permissions required by the transform.      * This role needs AWS Glue service role permissions to allow access to resources in AWS Glue. See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/attach-policy-iam-user.html Attach a Policy to IAM Users That Access AWS Glue> .     * This role needs permission to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the task run for this transform.
--
-- * 'mltName' - A user-defined name for the machine learning transform. Names are not guaranteed unique and can be changed at any time.
--
-- * 'mltParameters' - A @TransformParameters@ object. You can use parameters to tune (customize) the behavior of the machine learning transform by specifying what data it learns from and your preference on various tradeoffs (such as precious vs. recall, or accuracy vs. cost).
--
-- * 'mltMaxRetries' - The maximum number of times to retry after an @MLTaskRun@ of the machine learning transform fails.
--
-- * 'mltMaxCapacity' - The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated to task runs for this transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the <http://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/ AWS Glue pricing page> .  @MaxCapacity@ is a mutually exclusive option with @NumberOfWorkers@ and @WorkerType@ .     * If either @NumberOfWorkers@ or @WorkerType@ is set, then @MaxCapacity@ cannot be set.     * If @MaxCapacity@ is set then neither @NumberOfWorkers@ or @WorkerType@ can be set.     * If @WorkerType@ is set, then @NumberOfWorkers@ is required (and vice versa).     * @MaxCapacity@ and @NumberOfWorkers@ must both be at least 1. When the @WorkerType@ field is set to a value other than @Standard@ , the @MaxCapacity@ field is set automatically and becomes read-only.
--
-- * 'mltTimeout' - The timeout in minutes of the machine learning transform.
--
-- * 'mltDescription' - A user-defined, long-form description text for the machine learning transform. Descriptions are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed at any time.
--
-- * 'mltCreatedOn' - A timestamp. The time and date that this machine learning transform was created.
--
-- * 'mltTransformId' - The unique transform ID that is generated for the machine learning transform. The ID is guaranteed to be unique and does not change.
