-- | Creates a value of 'ConfusionMatrix' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmNumTrueNegatives' - The number of nonmatches in the data that the transform correctly rejected, in the confusion matrix for your transform.
--
-- * 'cmNumFalseNegatives' - The number of matches in the data that the transform didn't find, in the confusion matrix for your transform.
--
-- * 'cmNumTruePositives' - The number of matches in the data that the transform correctly found, in the confusion matrix for your transform.
--
-- * 'cmNumFalsePositives' - The number of nonmatches in the data that the transform incorrectly classified as a match, in the confusion matrix for your transform.
