-- | Creates a value of 'XMLClassifier' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'xcCreationTime' - The time that this classifier was registered.
--
-- * 'xcLastUpdated' - The time that this classifier was last updated.
--
-- * 'xcVersion' - The version of this classifier.
--
-- * 'xcRowTag' - The XML tag designating the element that contains each record in an XML document being parsed. This can't identify a self-closing element (closed by @/>@ ). An empty row element that contains only attributes can be parsed as long as it ends with a closing tag (for example, @<row item_a="A" item_b="B"></row>@ is okay, but @<row item_a="A" item_b="B" />@ is not).
--
-- * 'xcName' - The name of the classifier.
--
-- * 'xcClassification' - An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches.
