-- | Gets the Amazon EC2 Container Registry path of the docker image of the model that is hosted in this 'ProductionVariant' .
--
--
-- If you used the @registry/repository[:tag]@ form to specify the image path of the primary container when you created the model hosted in this @ProductionVariant@ , the path resolves to a path of the form @registry/repository[@digest]@ . A digest is a hash value that identifies a specific version of an image. For information about Amazon ECR paths, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html Pulling an Image> in the /Amazon ECR User Guide/ .
