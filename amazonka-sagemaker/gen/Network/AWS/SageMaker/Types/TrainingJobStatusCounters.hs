-- | Creates a value of 'TrainingJobStatusCounters' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tjscStopped' - The number of training jobs launched by a hyperparameter tuning job that were manually stopped.
--
-- * 'tjscRetryableError' - The number of training jobs that failed, but can be retried. A failed training job can be retried only if it failed because an internal service error occurred.
--
-- * 'tjscInProgress' - The number of in-progress training jobs launched by a hyperparameter tuning job.
--
-- * 'tjscNonRetryableError' - The number of training jobs that failed and can't be retried. A failed training job can't be retried if it failed because a client error occurred.
--
-- * 'tjscCompleted' - The number of completed training jobs launched by the hyperparameter tuning job.
