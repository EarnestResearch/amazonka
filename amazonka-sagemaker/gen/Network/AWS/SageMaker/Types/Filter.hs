-- | A conditional statement for a search expression that includes a resource property, a Boolean operator, and a value. Resources that match the statement are returned in the results from the 'Search' API.
--
--
-- If you specify a @Value@ , but not an @Operator@ , Amazon SageMaker uses the equals operator.
--
-- In search, there are several property types:
--
--     * Metrics    * To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form @"Metrics.<name>"@ , where @<name>@ is a metric name. For example, the following filter searches for training jobs with an @"accuracy"@ metric greater than @"0.9"@ :
--
-- @{@ 
--
-- @"Name": "Metrics.accuracy",@ 
--
-- @"Operator": "GreaterThan",@ 
--
-- @"Value": "0.9"@ 
--
-- @}@ 
--
--     * HyperParameters    * To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value with the form @"HyperParameters.<name>"@ . Decimal hyperparameter values are treated as a decimal in a comparison if the specified @Value@ is also a decimal value. If the specified @Value@ is an integer, the decimal hyperparameter values are treated as integers. For example, the following filter is satisfied by training jobs with a @"learning_rate"@ hyperparameter that is less than @"0.5"@ :
--
-- @{@ 
--
-- @"Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",@ 
--
-- @"Operator": "LessThan",@ 
--
-- @"Value": "0.5"@ 
--
-- @}@ 
--
--     * Tags    * To define a tag filter, enter a value with the form @Tags.<key>@ .

-- | Creates a value of 'Filter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fOperator' - A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate the filter. The operator field contains one of the following values:     * Equals    * The value of @Name@ equals @Value@ .     * NotEquals    * The value of @Name@ doesn't equal @Value@ .     * GreaterThan    * The value of @Name@ is greater than @Value@ . Not supported for text properties.     * GreaterThanOrEqualTo    * The value of @Name@ is greater than or equal to @Value@ . Not supported for text properties.     * LessThan    * The value of @Name@ is less than @Value@ . Not supported for text properties.     * LessThanOrEqualTo    * The value of @Name@ is less than or equal to @Value@ . Not supported for text properties.     * Contains    * The value of @Name@ contains the string @Value@ . A @SearchExpression@ can include only one @Contains@ operator. Only supported for text properties.     * Exists    * The @Name@ property exists.     * NotExists    * The @Name@ property does not exist.     * In    * The value of @Name@ is one of the comma delimited strings in @Value@ . Only supported for text properties.
--
-- * 'fValue' - A value used with @Name@ and @Operator@ to determine which resources satisfy the filter's condition. For numerical properties, @Value@ must be an integer or floating-point decimal. For timestamp properties, @Value@ must be an ISO 8601 date-time string of the following format: @YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS@ .
--
-- * 'fName' - A resource property name. For example, @TrainingJobName@ . For valid property names, see 'SearchRecord' . You must specify a valid property for the resource.
