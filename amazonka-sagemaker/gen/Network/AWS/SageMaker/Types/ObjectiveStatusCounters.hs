The objective metric status shows whether the final objective metric for the training job has been evaluated by the tuning job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process.

-- | Creates a value of 'ObjectiveStatusCounters' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'oscPending' - The number of training jobs that are in progress and pending evaluation of their final objective metric.
--
-- * 'oscSucceeded' - The number of training jobs whose final objective metric was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process.
--
-- * 'oscFailed' - The number of training jobs whose final objective metric was not evaluated and used in the hyperparameter tuning process. This typically occurs when the training job failed or did not emit an objective metric.
