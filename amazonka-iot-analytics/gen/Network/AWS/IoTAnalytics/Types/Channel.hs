-- | Creates a value of 'Channel' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCreationTime' - When the channel was created.
--
-- * 'cStatus' - The status of the channel.
--
-- * 'cArn' - The ARN of the channel.
--
-- * 'cStorage' - Where channel data is stored. You may choose one of "serviceManagedS3" or "customerManagedS3" storage. If not specified, the default is "serviceManagedS3". This cannot be changed after creation of the channel.
--
-- * 'cRetentionPeriod' - How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.
--
-- * 'cName' - The name of the channel.
--
-- * 'cLastUpdateTime' - When the channel was last updated.
