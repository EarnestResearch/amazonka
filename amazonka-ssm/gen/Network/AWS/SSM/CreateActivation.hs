-- Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments> in the /AWS Systems Manager User Guide/ .

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateActivation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'caDefaultInstanceName' - The name of the registered, managed instance as it will appear in the Systems Manager console or when you use the AWS command line tools to list Systems Manager resources. /Important:/ Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.
--
-- * 'caRegistrationLimit' - Specify the maximum number of managed instances you want to register. The default value is 1 instance.
--
-- * 'caExpirationDate' - The date by which this activation request should expire. The default value is 24 hours.
--
-- * 'caDescription' - A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register with Systems Manager.  /Important:/ Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.
--
-- * 'caTags' - Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:     * @Key=OS,Value=Windows@      * @Key=Environment,Value=Production@  /Important:/ When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on-premises servers or VMs. You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your on-premises servers and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed instance ID. This means they are listed in the AWS Systems Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with "mi-". For information about how to add tags to your managed instances, see 'AddTagsToResource' . For information about how to remove tags from your managed instances, see 'RemoveTagsFromResource' .
--
-- * 'caIAMRole' - The Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to assign to the managed instance. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole permissions for the Systems Manager service principal @ssm.amazonaws.com@ .
