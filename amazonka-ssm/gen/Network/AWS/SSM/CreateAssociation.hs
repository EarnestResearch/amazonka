-- Associates the specified Systems Manager document with the specified instances or targets.
--
--
-- When you associate a document with one or more instances using instance IDs or tags, SSM Agent running on the instance processes the document and configures the instance as specified.
--
-- If you associate a document with an instance that already has an associated document, the system returns the AssociationAlreadyExists exception.

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateAssociation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'caInstanceId' - The instance ID.
--
-- * 'caMaxErrors' - The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
--
-- * 'caScheduleExpression' - A cron expression when the association will be applied to the target(s).
--
-- * 'caOutputLocation' - An S3 bucket where you want to store the output details of the request.
--
-- * 'caSyncCompliance' - The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify @AUTO@ or @MANUAL@ . In @AUTO@ mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is @COMPLIANT@ . If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is @NON-COMPLIANT@ . In @MANUAL@ mode, you must specify the @AssociationId@ as a parameter for the 'PutComplianceItems' API action. In this case, compliance data is not managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the 'PutComplianceItems' API action. By default, all associations use @AUTO@ mode.
--
-- * 'caTargets' - The targets for the association. You can target instances by using tags, AWS Resource Groups, all instances in an AWS account, or individual instance IDs. For more information about choosing targets for an association, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state-manager-targets-and-rate-controls.html Using targets and rate controls with State Manager associations> in the /AWS Systems Manager User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'caParameters' - The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
--
-- * 'caDocumentVersion' - The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can be a specific version or the default version.
--
-- * 'caAutomationTargetParameterName' - Specify the target for the association. This target is required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using rate controls.
--
-- * 'caAssociationName' - Specify a descriptive name for the association.
--
-- * 'caComplianceSeverity' - The severity level to assign to the association.
--
-- * 'caMaxConcurrency' - The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new instance starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
--
-- * 'caName' - The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration information for the instance. You can specify Command or Automation documents. You can specify AWS-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For SSM documents that are shared with you from other AWS accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format: @arn:/partition/ :ssm:/region/ :/account-id/ :document//document-name/ @  For example: @arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document@  For AWS-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, @AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline@ or @My-Document@ .
