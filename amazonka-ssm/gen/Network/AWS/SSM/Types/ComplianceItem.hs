-- | Creates a value of 'ComplianceItem' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ciStatus' - The status of the compliance item. An item is either COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT.
--
-- * 'ciResourceId' - An ID for the resource. For a managed instance, this is the instance ID.
--
-- * 'ciResourceType' - The type of resource. @ManagedInstance@ is currently the only supported resource type.
--
-- * 'ciSeverity' - The severity of the compliance status. Severity can be one of the following: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational, Unspecified.
--
-- * 'ciExecutionSummary' - A summary for the compliance item. The summary includes an execution ID, the execution type (for example, command), and the execution time.
--
-- * 'ciDetails' - A "Key": "Value" tag combination for the compliance item.
--
-- * 'ciId' - An ID for the compliance item. For example, if the compliance item is a Windows patch, the ID could be the number of the KB article; for example: KB4010320.
--
-- * 'ciComplianceType' - The compliance type. For example, Association (for a State Manager association), Patch, or Custom:@string@ are all valid compliance types.
--
-- * 'ciTitle' - A title for the compliance item. For example, if the compliance item is a Windows patch, the title could be the title of the KB article for the patch; for example: Security Update for Active Directory Federation Services.
