-- | Creates a value of 'AssociationOverview' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aoDetailedStatus' - A detailed status of the association.
--
-- * 'aoStatus' - The status of the association. Status can be: Pending, Success, or Failed.
--
-- * 'aoAssociationStatusAggregatedCount' - Returns the number of targets for the association status. For example, if you created an association with two instances, and one of them was successful, this would return the count of instances by status.
