-- | Creates a value of 'InstancePatchState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ipsUnreportedNotApplicableCount' - The number of patches beyond the supported limit of @NotApplicableCount@ that are not reported by name to Systems Manager Inventory.
--
-- * 'ipsRebootOption' - Indicates the reboot option specified in the patch baseline.     * __RebootIfNeeded__ : Patch Manager tries to reboot the instance if it installed any patches, or if any patches are detected with a status of @InstalledPendingReboot@ .     * __NoReboot__ : Patch Manager attempts to install missing packages without trying to reboot the system. Patches installed with this option are assigned a status of @InstalledPendingReboot@ . These patches might not be in effect until a reboot is performed.
--
-- * 'ipsInstalledPendingRebootCount' - The number of patches installed by Patch Manager since the last time the instance was rebooted.
--
-- * 'ipsOwnerInformation' - Placeholder information. This field will always be empty in the current release of the service.
--
-- * 'ipsInstalledRejectedCount' - The number of instances with patches installed that are specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of /InstalledRejected/ were typically installed before they were added to a RejectedPatches list.
--
-- * 'ipsFailedCount' - The number of patches from the patch baseline that were attempted to be installed during the last patching operation, but failed to install.
--
-- * 'ipsInstalledOtherCount' - The number of patches not specified in the patch baseline that are installed on the instance.
--
-- * 'ipsMissingCount' - The number of patches from the patch baseline that are applicable for the instance but aren't currently installed.
--
-- * 'ipsInstallOverrideList' - An https URL or an Amazon S3 path-style URL to a list of patches to be installed. This patch installation list, which you maintain in an S3 bucket in YAML format and specify in the SSM document @AWS-RunPatchBaseline@ , overrides the patches specified by the default patch baseline. For more information about the @InstallOverrideList@ parameter, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-about-aws-runpatchbaseline.html About the SSM document AWS-RunPatchBaseline> in the /AWS Systems Manager User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ipsNotApplicableCount' - The number of patches from the patch baseline that aren't applicable for the instance and therefore aren't installed on the instance. This number may be truncated if the list of patch names is very large. The number of patches beyond this limit are reported in @UnreportedNotApplicableCount@ .
--
-- * 'ipsInstalledCount' - The number of patches from the patch baseline that are installed on the instance.
--
-- * 'ipsLastNoRebootInstallOperationTime' - The time of the last attempt to patch the instance with @NoReboot@ specified as the reboot option.
--
-- * 'ipsSnapshotId' - The ID of the patch baseline snapshot used during the patching operation when this compliance data was collected.
--
-- * 'ipsInstanceId' - The ID of the managed instance the high-level patch compliance information was collected for.
--
-- * 'ipsPatchGroup' - The name of the patch group the managed instance belongs to.
--
-- * 'ipsBaselineId' - The ID of the patch baseline used to patch the instance.
--
-- * 'ipsOperationStartTime' - The time the most recent patching operation was started on the instance.
--
-- * 'ipsOperationEndTime' - The time the most recent patching operation completed on the instance.
--
-- * 'ipsOperation' - The type of patching operation that was performed: SCAN (assess patch compliance state) or INSTALL (install missing patches).
