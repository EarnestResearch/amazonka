-- | Creates a value of 'ComplianceExecutionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cesExecutionId' - An ID created by the system when @PutComplianceItems@ was called. For example, @CommandID@ is a valid execution ID. You can use this ID in subsequent calls.
--
-- * 'cesExecutionType' - The type of execution. For example, @Command@ is a valid execution type.
--
-- * 'cesExecutionTime' - The time the execution ran as a datetime object that is saved in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.
