-- | Creates a value of 'SeveritySummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssLowCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of low. Low severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
--
-- * 'ssUnspecifiedCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of unspecified. Unspecified severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
--
-- * 'ssHighCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of high. High severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
--
-- * 'ssMediumCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of medium. Medium severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
--
-- * 'ssInformationalCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of informational. Informational severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
--
-- * 'ssCriticalCount' - The total number of resources or compliance items that have a severity level of critical. Critical severity is determined by the organization that published the compliance items.
