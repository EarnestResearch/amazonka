-- | Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.
--
--
-- A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for WINDOWS are PATCH_SET, PRODUCT, PRODUCT_FAMILY, CLASSIFICATION, and MSRC_SEVERITY. The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"], then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.
--
-- You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the @DescribePatchProperties@ command. For information about which patch properties can be used with each major operating system, see 'DescribePatchProperties' .
