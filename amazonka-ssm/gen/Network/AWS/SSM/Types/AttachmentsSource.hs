-- | Creates a value of 'AttachmentsSource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aValues' - The value of a key-value pair that identifies the location of an attachment to a document. The format for __Value__ depends on the type of key you specify.     * For the key /SourceUrl/ , the value is an S3 bucket location. For example: @"Values": [ "s3://my-bucket/my-folder" ]@      * For the key /S3FileUrl/ , the value is a file in an S3 bucket. For example: @"Values": [ "s3://my-bucket/my-folder/my-file.py" ]@      * For the key /AttachmentReference/ , the value is constructed from the name of another SSM document in your account, a version number of that document, and a file attached to that document version that you want to reuse. For example: @"Values": [ "MyOtherDocument/3/my-other-file.py" ]@  However, if the SSM document is shared with you from another account, the full SSM document ARN must be specified instead of the document name only. For example: @"Values": [ "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:document/OtherAccountDocument/3/their-file.py" ]@ 
--
-- * 'aKey' - The key of a key-value pair that identifies the location of an attachment to a document.
--
-- * 'aName' - The name of the document attachment file.
