-- | Creates a value of 'PatchRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'prApproveAfterDays' - The number of days after the release date of each patch matched by the rule that the patch is marked as approved in the patch baseline. For example, a value of @7@ means that patches are approved seven days after they are released. Not supported on Ubuntu Server.
--
-- * 'prApproveUntilDate' - The cutoff date for auto approval of released patches. Any patches released on or before this date are installed automatically. Not supported on Ubuntu Server. Enter dates in the format @YYYY-MM-DD@ . For example, @2020-12-31@ .
--
-- * 'prEnableNonSecurity' - For instances identified by the approval rule filters, enables a patch baseline to apply non-security updates available in the specified repository. The default value is 'false'. Applies to Linux instances only.
--
-- * 'prComplianceLevel' - A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a patch baseline.
--
-- * 'prPatchFilterGroup' - The patch filter group that defines the criteria for the rule.
