The approval state includes information about whether the patch is currently approved, due to be approved by a rule, explicitly approved, or explicitly rejected and the date the patch was or will be approved.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'epPatch' - Provides metadata for a patch, including information such as the KB ID, severity, classification and a URL for where more information can be obtained about the patch.
--
-- * 'epPatchStatus' - The status of the patch in a patch baseline. This includes information about whether the patch is currently approved, due to be approved by a rule, explicitly approved, or explicitly rejected and the date the patch was or will be approved.
