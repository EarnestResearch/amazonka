-- | Creates a value of 'TargetLocation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tlAccounts' - The AWS accounts targeted by the current Automation execution.
--
-- * 'tlTargetLocationMaxConcurrency' - The maximum number of AWS accounts and AWS regions allowed to run the Automation concurrently 
--
-- * 'tlTargetLocationMaxErrors' - The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops queueing additional Automation executions for the currently running Automation. 
--
-- * 'tlRegions' - The AWS Regions targeted by the current Automation execution.
--
-- * 'tlExecutionRoleName' - The Automation execution role used by the currently running Automation.
