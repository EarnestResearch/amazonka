-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aExpired' - Whether or not the activation is expired.
--
-- * 'aDefaultInstanceName' - A name for the managed instance when it is created.
--
-- * 'aActivationId' - The ID created by Systems Manager when you submitted the activation.
--
-- * 'aCreatedDate' - The date the activation was created.
--
-- * 'aRegistrationLimit' - The maximum number of managed instances that can be registered using this activation.
--
-- * 'aExpirationDate' - The date when this activation can no longer be used to register managed instances.
--
-- * 'aDescription' - A user defined description of the activation.
--
-- * 'aTags' - Tags assigned to the activation.
--
