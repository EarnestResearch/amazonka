-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fdFailureType' - The type of Automation failure. Failure types include the following: Action, Permission, Throttling, Verification, Internal.
--
-- * 'fdFailureStage' - The stage of the Automation execution when the failure occurred. The stages include the following: InputValidation, PreVerification, Invocation, PostVerification.
--
-- * 'fdDetails' - Detailed information about the Automation step failure.
