-- | Creates a value of 'CmafPackage' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cpHlsManifests' - A list of HLS manifest configurations
--
-- * 'cpSegmentDurationSeconds' - Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration.
--
-- * 'cpStreamSelection' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'cpEncryption' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'cpSegmentPrefix' - An optional custom string that is prepended to the name of each segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.
