-- | Creates a value of 'UpgradeTarget' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'utEngineVersion' - The version number of the upgrade target database engine.
--
-- * 'utIsMajorVersionUpgrade' - A value that indicates whether a database engine is upgraded to a major version.
--
-- * 'utEngine' - The name of the upgrade target database engine.
--
-- * 'utAutoUpgrade' - A value that indicates whether the target version is applied to any source DB instances that have AutoMinorVersionUpgrade set to true.
--
-- * 'utDescription' - The version of the database engine that a DB instance can be upgraded to.
