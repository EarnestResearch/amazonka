-- | Creates a value of 'PendingMaintenanceAction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pmaAutoAppliedAfterDate' - The date of the maintenance window when the action is applied. The maintenance action is applied to the resource during its first maintenance window after this date. If this date is specified, any @next-maintenance@ opt-in requests are ignored.
--
-- * 'pmaAction' - The type of pending maintenance action that is available for the resource.
--
-- * 'pmaOptInStatus' - Indicates the type of opt-in request that has been received for the resource.
--
-- * 'pmaDescription' - A description providing more detail about the maintenance action.
--
-- * 'pmaForcedApplyDate' - The date when the maintenance action is automatically applied. The maintenance action is applied to the resource on this date regardless of the maintenance window for the resource. If this date is specified, any @immediate@ opt-in requests are ignored.
--
-- * 'pmaCurrentApplyDate' - The effective date when the pending maintenance action is applied to the resource. This date takes into account opt-in requests received from the 'ApplyPendingMaintenanceAction' API, the @AutoAppliedAfterDate@ , and the @ForcedApplyDate@ . This value is blank if an opt-in request has not been received and nothing has been specified as @AutoAppliedAfterDate@ or @ForcedApplyDate@ .
