-- | Creates a value of 'Range' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rTo' - The maximum value in the range.
--
-- * 'rFrom' - The minimum value in the range.
--
-- * 'rStep' - The step value for the range. For example, if you have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step up by 1,000. Even though 7,500 is within the range, it isn't a valid value for the range. The valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000...
