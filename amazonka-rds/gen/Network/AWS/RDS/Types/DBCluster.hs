--
-- * 'dcEngine' - Provides the name of the database engine to be used for this DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcHTTPEndpointEnabled' - A value that indicates whether the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora Serverless DB cluster is enabled. When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS console with the query editor. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html Using the Data API for Aurora Serverless> in the /Amazon Aurora User Guide/ .

--
-- * 'dcPreferredMaintenanceWindow' - Specifies the weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
--
-- * 'dcAvailabilityZones' - Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in the DB cluster can be created.
--
-- * 'dcCharacterSetName' - If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.
--
-- * 'dcKMSKeyId' - If @StorageEncrypted@ is enabled, the AWS KMS key identifier for the encrypted DB cluster.

--
-- * 'dcBackupRetentionPeriod' - Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.
--
-- * 'dcDBSubnetGroup' - Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.
--
-- * 'dcActivityStreamMode' - The mode of the database activity stream. Database events such as a change or access generate an activity stream event. The database session can handle these events either synchronously or asynchronously. 
--
-- * 'dcDatabaseName' - Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcMultiAZ' - Specifies whether the DB cluster has instances in multiple Availability Zones.
--
-- * 'dcEngineMode' - The DB engine mode of the DB cluster, either @provisioned@ , @serverless@ , @parallelquery@ , @global@ , or @multimaster@ .
--
-- * 'dcEnabledCloudwatchLogsExports' - A list of log types that this DB cluster is configured to export to CloudWatch Logs. Log types vary by DB engine. For information about the log types for each DB engine, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html Amazon RDS Database Log Files> in the /Amazon Aurora User Guide./ 
--
-- * 'dcActivityStreamStatus' - The status of the database activity stream.
--
-- * 'dcAllocatedStorage' - For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, @AllocatedStorage@ specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora, @AllocatedStorage@ always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.
--
-- * 'dcCopyTagsToSnapshot' - Specifies whether tags are copied from the DB cluster to snapshots of the DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcClusterCreateTime' - Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
--

--
-- * 'dcActivityStreamKMSKeyId' - The AWS KMS key identifier used for encrypting messages in the database activity stream.
--
-- * 'dcPercentProgress' - Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.
--
-- * 'dcReaderEndpoint' - The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.  If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
--
-- * 'dcPort' - Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.
--
-- * 'dcDomainMemberships' - The Active Directory Domain membership records associated with the DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcDBClusterOptionGroupMemberships' - Provides the list of option group memberships for this DB cluster.

dcActivityStreamMode = lens _dcActivityStreamMode (\ s a -> s{_dcActivityStreamMode = a})

-- | Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

-- | Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.
dcPercentProgress :: Lens' DBCluster (Maybe Text)
dcPercentProgress = lens _dcPercentProgress (\ s a -> s{_dcPercentProgress = a})

-- | The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.  If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
