-- | Creates a value of 'DBClusterRole' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcrStatus' - Describes the state of association between the IAM role and the DB cluster. The Status property returns one of the following values:     * @ACTIVE@ - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB cluster and can be used to access other AWS services on your behalf.     * @PENDING@ - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the DB cluster.     * @INVALID@ - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM role in order to access other AWS services on your behalf.
--
-- * 'dcrRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that is associated with the DB cluster.
