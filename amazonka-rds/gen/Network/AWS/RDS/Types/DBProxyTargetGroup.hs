-- | Creates a value of 'DBProxyTargetGroup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dptgStatus' - The current status of this target group. A status of @available@ means the target group is correctly associated with a database. Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.
--
-- * 'dptgConnectionPoolConfig' - The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection pool for the target group.
--
-- * 'dptgTargetGroupARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.
--
-- * 'dptgUpdatedDate' - The date and time when the target group was last updated.
--
-- * 'dptgCreatedDate' - The date and time when the target group was first created.
--
-- * 'dptgDBProxyName' - The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this target group.
--
-- * 'dptgTargetGroupName' - The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique for all target groups owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region.
--
-- * 'dptgIsDefault' - Whether this target group is the first one used for connection requests by the associated proxy. Because each proxy is currently associated with a single target group, currently this setting is always @true@ .
