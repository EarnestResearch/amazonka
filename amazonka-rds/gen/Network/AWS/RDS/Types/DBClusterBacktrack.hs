-- | Creates a value of 'DBClusterBacktrack' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcbStatus' - The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the following values:     * @applying@ - The backtrack is currently being applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.     * @completed@ - The backtrack has successfully been applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.     * @failed@ - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.     * @pending@ - The backtrack is currently pending application to or rollback from the DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcbBacktrackIdentifier' - Contains the backtrack identifier.
--
-- * 'dcbBacktrackTo' - The timestamp of the time to which the DB cluster was backtracked.
--
-- * 'dcbDBClusterIdentifier' - Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.
--
-- * 'dcbBacktrackedFrom' - The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was backtracked.
--
-- * 'dcbBacktrackRequestCreationTime' - The timestamp of the time at which the backtrack was requested.
