When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether @DBSubnetGroupName@ is specified. If @DBSubnetGroupName@ isn't specified, and @PubliclyAccessible@ isn't specified, the following applies:     * If the default VPC in the target region doesn’t have an Internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.     * If the default VPC in the target region has an Internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public. If @DBSubnetGroupName@ is specified, and @PubliclyAccessible@ isn't specified, the following applies:     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an Internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.     * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an Internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public.

For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServerWinAuth.html Using Windows Authentication with an Amazon RDS DB Instance Running Microsoft SQL Server> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . For Oracle DB instances, Amazon RDS can use Kerberos Authentication to authenticate users that connect to the DB instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-kerberos.html Using Kerberos Authentication with Amazon RDS for Oracle> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cdiMonitoringInterval' - The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If @MonitoringRoleArn@ is specified, then you must also set @MonitoringInterval@ to a value other than 0. Valid Values: @0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60@ 
--
-- * 'cdiTDECredentialPassword' - The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device.
--
-- * 'cdiProcessorFeatures' - The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.
--
-- * 'cdiPromotionTier' - A value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster> in the /Amazon Aurora User Guide/ .  Default: 1 Valid Values: 0 - 15
--
-- * 'cdiLicenseModel' - License model information for this DB instance. Valid values: @license-included@ | @bring-your-own-license@ | @general-public-license@ 
--
-- * 'cdiPreferredMaintenanceWindow' - The time range each week during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

Format: @ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi@  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.  Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
--
-- * 'cdiPerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod' - The amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years). 
--
-- * 'cdiCharacterSetName' - For supported engines, indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified CharacterSet. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The character set is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see @CreateDBCluster@ .

--
-- * 'cdiKMSKeyId' - The AWS KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance. The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB instance with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB instance, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KM encryption key. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see @CreateDBCluster@ . If @StorageEncrypted@ is enabled, and you do not specify a value for the @KmsKeyId@ parameter, then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key. AWS KMS creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default encryption key for each AWS Region.
--
-- * 'cdiDBParameterGroupName' - The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this DB instance. If you do not specify a value, then the default DB parameter group for the specified DB engine and version is used.

For information on AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html Regions and Availability Zones> .  Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's AWS Region. Example: @us-east-1d@  Constraint: The @AvailabilityZone@ parameter can't be specified if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. The specified Availability Zone must be in the same AWS Region as the current endpoint. 
--
-- * 'cdiBackupRetentionPeriod' - The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster.
