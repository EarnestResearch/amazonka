-- Creates a new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing source DB instance. You can create a read replica for a DB instance running MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html Working with Read Replicas> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . 
--
--
-- Amazon Aurora doesn't support this action. Call the @CreateDBInstance@ action to create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster.
--
-- All read replica DB instances are created with backups disabled. All other DB instance attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance, except as specified.
--
-- /Important:/ Your source DB instance must have backup retention enabled.

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateDBInstanceReadReplica' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cdirrDeletionProtection' - A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html Deleting a DB Instance> . 
--
-- * 'cdirrPubliclyAccessible' - A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible, it is an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. For more information, see 'CreateDBInstance' .
--
-- * 'cdirrAutoMinorVersionUpgrade' - A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to the read replica during the maintenance window. Default: Inherits from the source DB instance
--
-- * 'cdirrDBSubnetGroupName' - Specifies a DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC. Constraints:     * Can only be specified if the source DB instance identifier specifies a DB instance in another AWS Region.     * If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.     * The specified DB subnet group must be in the same AWS Region in which the operation is running.     * All read replicas in one AWS Region that are created from the same source DB instance must either:>     * Specify DB subnet groups from the same VPC. All these read replicas are created in the same VPC.     * Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are created outside of any VPC. Example: @mySubnetgroup@ 
--
-- * 'cdirrMonitoringRoleARN' - The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, @arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess@ . For information on creating a monitoring role, go to <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . If @MonitoringInterval@ is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a @MonitoringRoleArn@ value.
--
-- * 'cdirrIOPS' - The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to be initially allocated for the DB instance.
--
-- * 'cdirrDomain' - The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. For Oracle DB instances, Amazon RDS can use Kerberos Authentication to authenticate users that connect to the DB instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-kerberos.html Using Kerberos Authentication with Amazon RDS for Oracle> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . For Microsoft SQL Server DB instances, Amazon RDS can use Windows Authentication to authenticate users that connect to the DB instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServerWinAuth.html Using Windows Authentication with an Amazon RDS DB Instance Running Microsoft SQL Server> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cdirrMonitoringInterval' - The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If @MonitoringRoleArn@ is specified, then you must also set @MonitoringInterval@ to a value other than 0. Valid Values: @0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60@ 
--
-- * 'cdirrPreSignedURL' - The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ API action in the source AWS Region that contains the source DB instance.  You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another AWS Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify @PreSignedUrl@ when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same AWS Region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:      * @DestinationRegion@ - The AWS Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This AWS Region is the same one where the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ action is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 AWS Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 AWS Region, then you call the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ action in the us-east-1 AWS Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ action in the us-west-2 AWS Region. For this example, the @DestinationRegion@ in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 AWS Region.      * @KmsKeyId@ - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the @CreateDBInstanceReadReplica@ action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.      * @SourceDBInstanceIdentifier@ - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region.

--
-- * 'cdirrDBInstanceClass' - The compute and memory capacity of the read replica, for example, @db.m4.large@ . Not all DB instance classes are available in all AWS Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html DB Instance Class> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide./  Default: Inherits from the source DB instance.
--
-- * 'cdirrPerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod' - The amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years). 
--
-- * 'cdirrEnablePerformanceInsights' - A value that indicates whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica.  For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html Using Amazon Performance Insights> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . 
--
-- * 'cdirrKMSKeyId' - The AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted read replica. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key. If you create an encrypted read replica in the same AWS Region as the source DB instance, then you do not have to specify a value for this parameter. The read replica is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one AWS Region in another AWS Region. You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance.
--
-- * 'cdirrDBParameterGroupName' - The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this DB instance. If you do not specify a value for @DBParameterGroupName@ , then Amazon RDS uses the @DBParameterGroup@ of source DB instance for a same region read replica, or the default @DBParameterGroup@ for the specified DB engine for a cross region read replica.

For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS> in the /Amazon RDS User Guide/ . This doesn't apply to SQL Server, which doesn't support cross-region replicas.
