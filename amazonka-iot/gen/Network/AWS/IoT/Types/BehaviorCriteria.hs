-- | Creates a value of 'BehaviorCriteria' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bcValue' - The value to be compared with the @metric@ .
--
-- * 'bcConsecutiveDatapointsToAlarm' - If a device is in violation of the behavior for the specified number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm occurs. If not specified, the default is 1.
--
-- * 'bcComparisonOperator' - The operator that relates the thing measured (@metric@ ) to the criteria (containing a @value@ or @statisticalThreshold@ ).
--
-- * 'bcStatisticalThreshold' - A statistical ranking (percentile) which indicates a threshold value by which a behavior is determined to be in compliance or in violation of the behavior.
--
-- * 'bcDurationSeconds' - Use this to specify the time duration over which the behavior is evaluated, for those criteria which have a time dimension (for example, @NUM_MESSAGES_SENT@ ). For a @statisticalThreshhold@ metric comparison, measurements from all devices are accumulated over this time duration before being used to calculate percentiles, and later, measurements from an individual device are also accumulated over this time duration before being given a percentile rank.
--
-- * 'bcConsecutiveDatapointsToClear' - If an alarm has occurred and the offending device is no longer in violation of the behavior for the specified number of consecutive datapoints, the alarm is cleared. If not specified, the default is 1.
