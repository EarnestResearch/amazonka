-- | Creates a value of 'JobExecutionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jesStatus' - The status of the job execution.
--
-- * 'jesLastUpdatedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was last updated.
--
-- * 'jesQueuedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was queued.
--
-- * 'jesExecutionNumber' - A string (consisting of the digits "0" through "9") which identifies this particular job execution on this particular device. It can be used later in commands which return or update job execution information.
--
-- * 'jesStartedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution started.
