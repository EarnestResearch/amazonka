-- | Creates a value of 'JobProcessDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfRemovedThings' - The number of things that are no longer scheduled to execute the job because they have been deleted or have been removed from the group that was a target of the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfQueuedThings' - The number of things that are awaiting execution of the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfFailedThings' - The number of things that failed executing the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfSucceededThings' - The number of things which successfully completed the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfInProgressThings' - The number of things currently executing the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfCanceledThings' - The number of things that cancelled the job.
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfTimedOutThings' - The number of things whose job execution status is @TIMED_OUT@ .
--
-- * 'jpdNumberOfRejectedThings' - The number of things that rejected the job.
--
-- * 'jpdProcessingTargets' - The target devices to which the job execution is being rolled out. This value will be null after the job execution has finished rolling out to all the target devices.
