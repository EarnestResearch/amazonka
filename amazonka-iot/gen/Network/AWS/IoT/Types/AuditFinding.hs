-- | Creates a value of 'AuditFinding' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'afTaskId' - The ID of the audit that generated this result (finding).
--
-- * 'afFindingTime' - The time the result (finding) was discovered.
--
-- * 'afTaskStartTime' - The time the audit started.
--
-- * 'afReasonForNonComplianceCode' - A code that indicates the reason that the resource was noncompliant.
--
-- * 'afSeverity' - The severity of the result (finding).
--
-- * 'afRelatedResources' - The list of related resources.
--
-- * 'afCheckName' - The audit check that generated this result.
--
-- * 'afNonCompliantResource' - The resource that was found to be noncompliant with the audit check.
--
-- * 'afReasonForNonCompliance' - The reason the resource was noncompliant.
--
-- * 'afFindingId' - A unique identifier for this set of audit findings. This identifier is used to apply mitigation tasks to one or more sets of findings.
