-- | Creates a value of 'TopicRuleDestination' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'trdStatus' - The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:     * IN_PROGRESS    * A topic rule destination was created but has not been confirmed. You can set @status@ to @IN_PROGRESS@ by calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ . Calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.     * ENABLED    * Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this destination is allowed. You can set @status@ to @DISABLED@ by calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ .     * DISABLED    * Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this destination is not allowed. You can set @status@ to @ENABLED@ by calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ .     * ERROR    * Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the confirmation timed out. You can call @GetTopicRuleDestination@ for details about the error. You can set @status@ to @IN_PROGRESS@ by calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ . Calling @UpdateTopicRuleDestination@ causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.
--
-- * 'trdHttpURLProperties' - Properties of the HTTP URL.
--
-- * 'trdArn' - The topic rule destination URL.
--
-- * 'trdStatusReason' - Additional details or reason why the topic rule destination is in the current status.
