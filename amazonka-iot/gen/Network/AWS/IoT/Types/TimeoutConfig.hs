-- * 'tcInProgressTimeoutInMinutes' - Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, this device has to finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can be anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job executions for the job. Whenever a job execution remains in the IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execution will fail and switch to the terminal @TIMED_OUT@ status.
