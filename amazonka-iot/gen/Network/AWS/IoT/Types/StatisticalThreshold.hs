--
-- * 'stStatistic' - The percentile which resolves to a threshold value by which compliance with a behavior is determined. Metrics are collected over the specified period (@durationSeconds@ ) from all reporting devices in your account and statistical ranks are calculated. Then, the measurements from a device are collected over the same period. If the accumulated measurements from the device fall above or below (@comparisonOperator@ ) the value associated with the percentile specified, then the device is considered to be in compliance with the behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.
