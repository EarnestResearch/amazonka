-- | Creates a value of 'ActiveViolation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'avLastViolationValue' - The value of the metric (the measurement) which caused the most recent violation.
--
-- * 'avLastViolationTime' - The time the most recent violation occurred.
--
-- * 'avViolationStartTime' - The time the violation started.
--
-- * 'avViolationId' - The ID of the active violation.
--
-- * 'avBehavior' - The behavior which is being violated.
--
-- * 'avSecurityProfileName' - The security profile whose behavior is in violation.
--
-- * 'avThingName' - The name of the thing responsible for the active violation.
