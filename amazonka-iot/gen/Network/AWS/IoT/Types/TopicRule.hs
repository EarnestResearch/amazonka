-- | Creates a value of 'TopicRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'trCreatedAt' - The date and time the rule was created.
--
-- * 'trActions' - The actions associated with the rule.
--
-- * 'trAwsIotSqlVersion' - The version of the SQL rules engine to use when evaluating the rule.
--
-- * 'trErrorAction' - The action to perform when an error occurs.
--
-- * 'trRuleDisabled' - Specifies whether the rule is disabled.

-- * 'trRuleName' - The name of the rule.
--
-- * 'trSql' - The SQL statement used to query the topic. When using a SQL query with multiple lines, be sure to escape the newline characters.
