-- | Creates a value of 'JobSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jsStatus' - The job summary status.
--
-- * 'jsJobId' - The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.
--
-- * 'jsLastUpdatedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job was last updated.
--
-- * 'jsJobARN' - The job ARN.
--
-- * 'jsCreatedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job was created.
--
-- * 'jsThingGroupId' - The ID of the thing group.
--
-- * 'jsCompletedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job completed.
--
-- * 'jsTargetSelection' - Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.
