-- | Creates a value of 'AuditCheckDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'acdTotalResourcesCount' - The number of resources on which the check was performed.
--
-- * 'acdCheckCompliant' - True if the check is complete and found all resources compliant.
--
-- * 'acdNonCompliantResourcesCount' - The number of resources that were found noncompliant during the check.
--
-- * 'acdErrorCode' - The code of any error encountered when this check is performed during this audit. One of "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS" or "AUDIT_CHECK_DISABLED".
--
-- * 'acdMessage' - The message associated with any error encountered when this check is performed during this audit.
--
-- * 'acdCheckRunStatus' - The completion status of this check. One of "IN_PROGRESS", "WAITING_FOR_DATA_COLLECTION", "CANCELED", "COMPLETED_COMPLIANT", "COMPLETED_NON_COMPLIANT", or "FAILED".
