-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pucExpiresInSec' - How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values are 60 - 3600, the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the job document.
--
-- * 'pucRoleARN' - The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are stored. The role must also grant permission for IoT to download the files.
