-- | Creates a value of 'ScheduledInstanceRecurrenceRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sirrFrequency' - The frequency (@Daily@ , @Weekly@ , or @Monthly@ ).
--
-- * 'sirrOccurrenceRelativeToEnd' - Indicates whether the occurrence is relative to the end of the specified week or month. You can't specify this value with a daily schedule.
--
-- * 'sirrOccurrenceDays' - The days. For a monthly schedule, this is one or more days of the month (1-31). For a weekly schedule, this is one or more days of the week (1-7, where 1 is Sunday). You can't specify this value with a daily schedule. If the occurrence is relative to the end of the month, you can specify only a single day.
--
-- * 'sirrOccurrenceUnit' - The unit for @OccurrenceDays@ (@DayOfWeek@ or @DayOfMonth@ ). This value is required for a monthly schedule. You can't specify @DayOfWeek@ with a weekly schedule. You can't specify this value with a daily schedule.
--
-- * 'sirrInterval' - The interval quantity. The interval unit depends on the value of @Frequency@ . For example, every 2 weeks or every 2 months.
