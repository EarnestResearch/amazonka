-- | Creates a value of 'SpotOptionsRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sorInstanceInterruptionBehavior' - The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is @terminate@ .
--
-- * 'sorSingleAvailabilityZone' - Indicates that the fleet launches all Spot Instances into a single Availability Zone. Supported only for fleets of type @instant@ .
--
-- * 'sorMaxTotalPrice' - The maximum amount per hour for Spot Instances that you're willing to pay.
--
-- * 'sorMinTargetCapacity' - The minimum target capacity for Spot Instances in the fleet. If the minimum target capacity is not reached, the fleet launches no instances.
--
-- * 'sorInstancePoolsToUseCount' - The number of Spot pools across which to allocate your target Spot capacity. Valid only when Spot __AllocationStrategy__ is set to @lowest-price@ . EC2 Fleet selects the cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot capacity across the number of Spot pools that you specify.
--
-- * 'sorSingleInstanceType' - Indicates that the fleet uses a single instance type to launch all Spot Instances in the fleet. Supported only for fleets of type @instant@ .
--
-- * 'sorAllocationStrategy' - Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the EC2 Fleet. If the allocation strategy is @lowest-price@ , EC2 Fleet launches instances from the Spot Instance pools with the lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy. If the allocation strategy is @diversified@ , EC2 Fleet launches instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify. If the allocation strategy is @capacity-optimized@ , EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.
