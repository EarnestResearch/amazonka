-- | Creates a value of 'Host' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hReleaseTime' - The time that the Dedicated Host was released.
--
-- * 'hState' - The Dedicated Host's state.
--
-- * 'hClientToken' - Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html How to Ensure Idempotency> .
--
-- * 'hAvailabilityZoneId' - The ID of the Availability Zone in which the Dedicated Host is allocated.
--
-- * 'hHostId' - The ID of the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hAvailableCapacity' - Information about the instances running on the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hHostReservationId' - The reservation ID of the Dedicated Host. This returns a @null@ response if the Dedicated Host doesn't have an associated reservation.
--
-- * 'hAllowsMultipleInstanceTypes' - Indicates whether the Dedicated Host supports multiple instance types of the same instance family, or a specific instance type only. @one@ indicates that the Dedicated Host supports multiple instance types in the instance family. @off@ indicates that the Dedicated Host supports a single instance type only.
--
-- * 'hHostProperties' - The hardware specifications of the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hOwnerId' - The ID of the AWS account that owns the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hAvailabilityZone' - The Availability Zone of the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hInstances' - The IDs and instance type that are currently running on the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hAllocationTime' - The time that the Dedicated Host was allocated.
--
-- * 'hMemberOfServiceLinkedResourceGroup' - Indicates whether the Dedicated Host is in a host resource group. If __memberOfServiceLinkedResourceGroup__ is @true@ , the host is in a host resource group; otherwise, it is not.
--
-- * 'hHostRecovery' - Indicates whether host recovery is enabled or disabled for the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hAutoPlacement' - Whether auto-placement is on or off.
--
-- * 'hTags' - Any tags assigned to the Dedicated Host.
