-- | Creates a value of 'HostProperties' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hpInstanceFamily' - The instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, @m5@ .
--
-- * 'hpInstanceType' - The instance type supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, @m5.large@ . If the host supports multiple instance types, no __instanceType__ is returned.
--
-- * 'hpTotalVCPUs' - The total number of vCPUs on the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hpCores' - The number of cores on the Dedicated Host.
--
-- * 'hpSockets' - The number of sockets on the Dedicated Host.
