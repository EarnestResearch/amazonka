-- | Creates a value of 'AuthorizationRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'arStatus' - The current state of the authorization rule.
--
-- * 'arAccessAll' - Indicates whether the authorization rule grants access to all clients.
--
-- * 'arClientVPNEndpointId' - The ID of the Client VPN endpoint with which the authorization rule is associated.
--
-- * 'arGroupId' - The ID of the Active Directory group to which the authorization rule grants access.
--
-- * 'arDestinationCidr' - The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the network to which the authorization rule applies.
--
-- * 'arDescription' - A brief description of the authorization rule.
