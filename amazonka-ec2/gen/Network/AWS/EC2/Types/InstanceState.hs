-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'isName' - The current state of the instance.
--
-- * 'isCode' - The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored. The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.  The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:     * @0@ : @pending@      * @16@ : @running@      * @32@ : @shutting-down@      * @48@ : @terminated@      * @64@ : @stopping@      * @80@ : @stopped@  You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.
