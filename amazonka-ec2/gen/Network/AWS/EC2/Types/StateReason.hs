-- | Creates a value of 'StateReason' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'srCode' - The reason code for the state change.
--
-- * 'srMessage' - The message for the state change.     * @Server.InsufficientInstanceCapacity@ : There was insufficient capacity available to satisfy the launch request.     * @Server.InternalError@ : An internal error caused the instance to terminate during launch.     * @Server.ScheduledStop@ : The instance was stopped due to a scheduled retirement.     * @Server.SpotInstanceShutdown@ : The instance was stopped because the number of Spot requests with a maximum price equal to or higher than the Spot price exceeded available capacity or because of an increase in the Spot price.     * @Server.SpotInstanceTermination@ : The instance was terminated because the number of Spot requests with a maximum price equal to or higher than the Spot price exceeded available capacity or because of an increase in the Spot price.     * @Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown@ : The instance was shut down using the @shutdown -h@ command from the instance.     * @Client.InstanceTerminated@ : The instance was terminated or rebooted during AMI creation.     * @Client.InternalError@ : A client error caused the instance to terminate during launch.     * @Client.InvalidSnapshot.NotFound@ : The specified snapshot was not found.     * @Client.UserInitiatedHibernate@ : Hibernation was initiated on the instance.     * @Client.UserInitiatedShutdown@ : The instance was shut down using the Amazon EC2 API.     * @Client.VolumeLimitExceeded@ : The limit on the number of EBS volumes or total storage was exceeded. Decrease usage or request an increase in your account limits.
