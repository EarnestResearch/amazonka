-- | Creates a value of 'EBSBlockDevice' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ebdDeleteOnTermination' - Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination Preserving Amazon EBS Volumes on Instance Termination> in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
--
-- * 'ebdVolumeSize' - The size of the volume, in GiB. Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size. Constraints: 1-16384 for General Purpose SSD (@gp2@ ), 4-16384 for Provisioned IOPS SSD (@io1@ ), 500-16384 for Throughput Optimized HDD (@st1@ ), 500-16384 for Cold HDD (@sc1@ ), and 1-1024 for Magnetic (@standard@ ) volumes. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size.
--
-- * 'ebdIOPS' - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports. For @io1@ volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For @gp2@ volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html Amazon EBS Volume Types> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ . Constraints: Range is 100-16,000 IOPS for @gp2@ volumes and 100 to 64,000IOPS for @io1@ volumes in most Regions. Maximum @io1@ IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances Nitro-based instances> . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html Amazon EBS Volume Types> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ . Condition: This parameter is required for requests to create @io1@ volumes; it is not used in requests to create @gp2@ , @st1@ , @sc1@ , or @standard@ volumes.
--
-- * 'ebdEncrypted' - Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to @true@ depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters Amazon EBS Encryption> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ . In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances Supported Instance Types> . This parameter is not returned by .
--
-- * 'ebdKMSKeyId' - Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted. This parameter is only supported on @BlockDeviceMapping@ objects called by <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html RunInstances> , <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html RequestSpotFleet> , and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html RequestSpotInstances> .
--
-- * 'ebdVolumeType' - The volume type. If you set the type to @io1@ , you must also specify the __Iops__ parameter. If you set the type to @gp2@ , @st1@ , @sc1@ , or @standard@ , you must omit the __Iops__ parameter. Default: @gp2@ 
--
-- * 'ebdSnapshotId' - The ID of the snapshot.
