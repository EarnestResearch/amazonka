-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceStatusEvent' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iseNotBefore' - The earliest scheduled start time for the event.
--
-- * 'iseCode' - The event code.
--
-- * 'iseInstanceEventId' - The ID of the event.
--
-- * 'iseDescription' - A description of the event. After a scheduled event is completed, it can still be described for up to a week. If the event has been completed, this description starts with the following text: [Completed].
--
-- * 'iseNotBeforeDeadline' - The deadline for starting the event.
--
-- * 'iseNotAfter' - The latest scheduled end time for the event.
