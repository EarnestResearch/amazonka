-- | Describes the instance's Capacity Reservation targeting preferences. The action returns the @capacityReservationPreference@ response element if the instance is configured to run in On-Demand capacity, or if it is configured in run in any @open@ Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone). The action returns the @capacityReservationTarget@ response element if the instance explicily targets a specific Capacity Reservation.

-- | Creates a value of 'CapacityReservationSpecificationResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'crsCapacityReservationTarget' - Information about the targeted Capacity Reservation.
--
-- * 'crsCapacityReservationPreference' - Describes the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Possible preferences include:     * @open@ - The instance can run in any @open@ Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).     * @none@ - The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs in On-Demand capacity.
