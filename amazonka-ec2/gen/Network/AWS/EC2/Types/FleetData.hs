-- | Creates a value of 'FleetData' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fdClientToken' - Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html Ensuring Idempotency> . Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters
--
-- * 'fdTargetCapacitySpecification' - The number of units to request. You can choose to set the target capacity in terms of instances or a performance characteristic that is important to your application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is @maintain@ , you can specify a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.
--
-- * 'fdSpotOptions' - The configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy' - Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdOnDemandOptions' - The allocation strategy of On-Demand Instances in an EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdFleetState' - The state of the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdLaunchTemplateConfigs' - The launch template and overrides.
--
-- * 'fdValidUntil' - The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, /YYYY/ -/MM/ -/DD/ T/HH/ :/MM/ :/SS/ Z). At this point, no new instance requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. The default end date is 7 days from the current date. 
--
-- * 'fdTerminateInstancesWithExpiration' - Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when the EC2 Fleet expires. 
--
-- * 'fdInstances' - Information about the instances that were launched by the fleet. Valid only when __Type__ is set to @instant@ .
--
-- * 'fdFulfilledCapacity' - The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target capacity.
--
-- * 'fdType' - The type of request. Indicates whether the EC2 Fleet only @requests@ the target capacity, or also attempts to @maintain@ it. If you request a certain target capacity, EC2 Fleet only places the required requests; it does not attempt to replenish instances if capacity is diminished, and it does not submit requests in alternative capacity pools if capacity is unavailable. To maintain a certain target capacity, EC2 Fleet places the required requests to meet this target capacity. It also automatically replenishes any interrupted Spot Instances. Default: @maintain@ .
--
-- * 'fdValidFrom' - The start date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, /YYYY/ -/MM/ -/DD/ T/HH/ :/MM/ :/SS/ Z). The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately. 
--
-- * 'fdReplaceUnhealthyInstances' - Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy instances.
--
-- * 'fdFulfilledOnDemandCapacity' - The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target On-Demand capacity.
--
-- * 'fdFleetId' - The ID of the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdErrors' - Information about the instances that could not be launched by the fleet. Valid only when __Type__ is set to @instant@ .
--
-- * 'fdCreateTime' - The creation date and time of the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'fdTags' - The tags for an EC2 Fleet resource.
--
-- * 'fdActivityStatus' - The progress of the EC2 Fleet. If there is an error, the status is @error@ . After all requests are placed, the status is @pending_fulfillment@ . If the size of the EC2 Fleet is equal to or greater than its target capacity, the status is @fulfilled@ . If the size of the EC2 Fleet is decreased, the status is @pending_termination@ while instances are terminating.
