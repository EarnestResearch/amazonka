-- | Creates a value of 'NatGateway' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ngState' - The state of the NAT gateway.     * @pending@ : The NAT gateway is being created and is not ready to process traffic.     * @failed@ : The NAT gateway could not be created. Check the @failureCode@ and @failureMessage@ fields for the reason.     * @available@ : The NAT gateway is able to process traffic. This status remains until you delete the NAT gateway, and does not indicate the health of the NAT gateway.     * @deleting@ : The NAT gateway is in the process of being terminated and may still be processing traffic.     * @deleted@ : The NAT gateway has been terminated and is no longer processing traffic.
--
-- * 'ngFailureCode' - If the NAT gateway could not be created, specifies the error code for the failure. (@InsufficientFreeAddressesInSubnet@ | @Gateway.NotAttached@ | @InvalidAllocationID.NotFound@ | @Resource.AlreadyAssociated@ | @InternalError@ | @InvalidSubnetID.NotFound@ )
--
-- * 'ngVPCId' - The ID of the VPC in which the NAT gateway is located.
--
-- * 'ngFailureMessage' - If the NAT gateway could not be created, specifies the error message for the failure, that corresponds to the error code.     * For InsufficientFreeAddressesInSubnet: "Subnet has insufficient free addresses to create this NAT gateway"     * For Gateway.NotAttached: "Network vpc-xxxxxxxx has no Internet gateway attached"     * For InvalidAllocationID.NotFound: "Elastic IP address eipalloc-xxxxxxxx could not be associated with this NAT gateway"     * For Resource.AlreadyAssociated: "Elastic IP address eipalloc-xxxxxxxx is already associated"     * For InternalError: "Network interface eni-xxxxxxxx, created and used internally by this NAT gateway is in an invalid state. Please try again."     * For InvalidSubnetID.NotFound: "The specified subnet subnet-xxxxxxxx does not exist or could not be found."
--
-- * 'ngNatGatewayId' - The ID of the NAT gateway.
--
-- * 'ngSubnetId' - The ID of the subnet in which the NAT gateway is located.
--
-- * 'ngDeleteTime' - The date and time the NAT gateway was deleted, if applicable.
--
-- * 'ngProvisionedBandwidth' - Reserved. If you need to sustain traffic greater than the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html documented limits> , contact us through the <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home? Support Center> .
--
-- * 'ngNatGatewayAddresses' - Information about the IP addresses and network interface associated with the NAT gateway.
--
-- * 'ngCreateTime' - The date and time the NAT gateway was created.
--
-- * 'ngTags' - The tags for the NAT gateway.
