-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iInstanceId' - The ID of the instance.
--
-- * 'iOutpostARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
--
-- * 'iSystemStatus' - Reports impaired functionality that stems from issues related to the systems that support an instance, such as hardware failures and network connectivity problems.
--
-- * 'iEvents' - Any scheduled events associated with the instance.
--
-- * 'iAvailabilityZone' - The Availability Zone of the instance.
--
-- * 'iInstanceStatus' - Reports impaired functionality that stems from issues internal to the instance, such as impaired reachability.
--
-- * 'iInstanceState' - The intended state of the instance. 'DescribeInstanceStatus' requires that an instance be in the @running@ state.
