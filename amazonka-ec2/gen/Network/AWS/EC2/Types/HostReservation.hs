-- | Creates a value of 'HostReservation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hrState' - The state of the reservation.
--
-- * 'hrInstanceFamily' - The instance family of the Dedicated Host Reservation. The instance family on the Dedicated Host must be the same in order for it to benefit from the reservation.
--
-- * 'hrCurrencyCode' - The currency in which the @upfrontPrice@ and @hourlyPrice@ amounts are specified. At this time, the only supported currency is @USD@ .
--
-- * 'hrHostReservationId' - The ID of the reservation that specifies the associated Dedicated Hosts.
--
-- * 'hrStart' - The date and time that the reservation started.
--
-- * 'hrHourlyPrice' - The hourly price of the reservation.
--
-- * 'hrCount' - The number of Dedicated Hosts the reservation is associated with.
--
-- * 'hrUpfrontPrice' - The upfront price of the reservation.
--
-- * 'hrEnd' - The date and time that the reservation ends.
--
-- * 'hrHostIdSet' - The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts associated with the reservation.
--
-- * 'hrOfferingId' - The ID of the reservation. This remains the same regardless of which Dedicated Hosts are associated with it.
--
-- * 'hrDuration' - The length of the reservation's term, specified in seconds. Can be @31536000 (1 year)@ | @94608000 (3 years)@ .
--
-- * 'hrTags' - Any tags assigned to the Dedicated Host Reservation.
--
-- * 'hrPaymentOption' - The payment option selected for this reservation.
