-- | Creates a value of 'ClientVPNRoute' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cvrStatus' - The current state of the route.
--
-- * 'cvrOrigin' - Indicates how the route was associated with the Client VPN endpoint. @associate@ indicates that the route was automatically added when the target network was associated with the Client VPN endpoint. @add-route@ indicates that the route was manually added using the __CreateClientVpnRoute__ action.
--
-- * 'cvrClientVPNEndpointId' - The ID of the Client VPN endpoint with which the route is associated.
--
-- * 'cvrTargetSubnet' - The ID of the subnet through which traffic is routed.
--
-- * 'cvrDestinationCidr' - The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the route destination.
--
-- * 'cvrType' - The route type.
--
-- * 'cvrDescription' - A brief description of the route.
