-- | Creates a value of 'Route' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rVPCPeeringConnectionId' - The ID of a VPC peering connection.
--
-- * 'rInstanceId' - The ID of a NAT instance in your VPC.
--
-- * 'rOrigin' - Describes how the route was created.     * @CreateRouteTable@ - The route was automatically created when the route table was created.     * @CreateRoute@ - The route was manually added to the route table.     * @EnableVgwRoutePropagation@ - The route was propagated by route propagation.
--
-- * 'rState' - The state of the route. The @blackhole@ state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, or the specified NAT instance has been terminated).
--
-- * 'rEgressOnlyInternetGatewayId' - The ID of the egress-only internet gateway.
--
-- * 'rDestinationIPv6CidrBlock' - The IPv6 CIDR block used for the destination match.
--
-- * 'rLocalGatewayId' - The ID of the local gateway.
--
-- * 'rNatGatewayId' - The ID of a NAT gateway.
--
-- * 'rNetworkInterfaceId' - The ID of the network interface.
--
-- * 'rTransitGatewayId' - The ID of a transit gateway.
--
-- * 'rGatewayId' - The ID of a gateway attached to your VPC.
--
-- * 'rInstanceOwnerId' - The AWS account ID of the owner of the instance.
--
-- * 'rDestinationPrefixListId' - The prefix of the AWS service.
--
-- * 'rDestinationCidrBlock' - The IPv4 CIDR block used for the destination match.
