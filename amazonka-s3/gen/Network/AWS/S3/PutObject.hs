--
-- Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.
--
--
-- Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.
--
-- Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.
--
-- To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the @Content-MD5@ header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.
--
-- You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption> .
--
--     * Access Permissions    * You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:
--
--     * Specify a canned ACL with the @x-amz-acl@ request header. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL Canned ACL> .
--
--     * Specify access permissions explicitly with the @x-amz-grant-read@ , @x-amz-grant-read-acp@ , @x-amz-grant-write-acp@ , and @x-amz-grant-full-control@ headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview> .
--
--
--
-- You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.
--
--     * Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers    * You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. 
--
--     * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.
--
--     * x-amz-server-side​-encryption
--
--     * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id
--
--     * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context
--
--
--
-- /Important:/ All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.
--
-- For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS> .
--
--     * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.
--
--     * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm
--
--     * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key
--
--     * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5
--
--
--
-- For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in KMS (SSE-KMS), see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS> .
--
--
--
--     * Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers    * You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html Using ACLs> . With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:
--
--     * Specify a canned ACL (@x-amz-acl@ ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL Canned ACL> .
--
--     * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview> . In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly use:
--
--     * x-amz-grant-read
--
--     * x-amz-grant-write
--
--     * x-amz-grant-read-acp
--
--     * x-amz-grant-write-acp
--
--     * x-amz-grant-full-control
--
--
--
-- You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
--
--     * @emailAddress@ – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account
--
-- /Important:/ Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: 
--
--     * US East (N. Virginia)
--
--     * US West (N. California)
--
--     * US West (Oregon)
--
--     * Asia Pacific (Singapore)
--
--     * Asia Pacific (Sydney)
--
--     * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
--
--     * EU (Ireland)
--
--     * South America (São Paulo)
--
--
--
-- For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region Regions and Endpoints> in the AWS General Reference
--
--     * @id@ – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account
--
--     * @uri@ – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
--
--
--
-- For example, the following @x-amz-grant-read@ header grants the AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:
--
-- @x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" @ 
--
--
--
--     * Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers    * You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. 
--

--
--     * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

--
--
--
--
--
-- __Storage Class Options__ 
--
-- By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly created objects. The Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html Storage Classes> in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
--
-- __Versioning__ 
--
-- If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the @x-amz-version-id response@ header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see 'GetBucketVersioning' . If you enable versioning for a bucket, when Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.

-- | Creates a value of 'PutObject' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'poContentLength' - Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13> .
--
-- * 'poObjectLockMode' - The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
--
-- * 'poExpires' - The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21> .
--
-- * 'poGrantReadACP' - Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
--
-- * 'poSSECustomerAlgorithm' - Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
--
-- * 'poSSECustomerKey' - Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the @x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm@ header.
--
-- * 'poRequestPayer' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'poGrantWriteACP' - Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
--
-- * 'poWebsiteRedirectLocation' - If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html Object Key and Metadata> . In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket: @x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html@  In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website: @x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/@  For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html Hosting Websites on Amazon S3> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html How to Configure Website Page Redirects> . 
--
-- * 'poGrantRead' - Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
--
-- * 'poStorageClass' - If you don't specify, Standard is the default storage class. Amazon S3 supports other storage classes.
--
-- * 'poSSECustomerKeyMD5' - Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
--
-- * 'poSSEKMSKeyId' - If @x-amz-server-side-encryption@ is present and has the value of @aws:kms@ , this header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) symmetrical customer managed customer master key (CMK) that was used for the object. If the value of @x-amz-server-side-encryption@ is @aws:kms@ , this header specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK that will be used for the object. If you specify @x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms@ , but do not provide@x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id@ , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS to protect the data.
--
-- * 'poGrantFullControl' - Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
--
-- * 'poContentEncoding' - Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11> .
--
-- * 'poTagging' - The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")
--
-- * 'poContentMD5' - The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more information about REST request authentication, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html REST Authentication> .
--
-- * 'poObjectLockRetainUntilDate' - The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
--
-- * 'poMetadata' - A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
--
-- * 'poSSEKMSEncryptionContext' - Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
--
-- * 'poCacheControl' - Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9> .
--
-- * 'poContentLanguage' - The language the content is in.
--
-- * 'poObjectLockLegalHoldStatus' - Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html Object Lock> .
--
-- * 'poACL' - The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL Canned ACL> .
--
-- * 'poContentDisposition' - Specifies presentational information for the object. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1> .
--
-- * 'poServerSideEncryption' - The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
--
-- * 'poContentType' - A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more information, see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17> .
--
-- * 'poBucket' - Bucket name to which the PUT operation was initiated.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ .s3-accesspoint./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html Using Access Points> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'poKey' - Object key for which the PUT operation was initiated.
--
-- * 'poBody' - Object data.
