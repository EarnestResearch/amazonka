-- | Creates a value of 'Input' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iState' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'iSecurityGroups' - A list of IDs for all the Input Security Groups attached to the input.
--
-- * 'iARN' - The Unique ARN of the input (generated, immutable).
--
-- * 'iSources' - A list of the sources of the input (PULL-type).
--
-- * 'iDestinations' - A list of the destinations of the input (PUSH-type).
--
-- * 'iName' - The user-assigned name (This is a mutable value).
--
-- * 'iAttachedChannels' - A list of channel IDs that that input is attached to (currently an input can only be attached to one channel).
--
-- * 'iId' - The generated ID of the input (unique for user account, immutable).
--
-- * 'iInputClass' - STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this input. If the channel is also STANDARD, both sources will be ingested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the first source will be ingested; the second source will always be ignored, even if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE - You can connect only one source to this input. If the ChannelClass is also  SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value is not valid because the channel requires two sources in the input.
--
-- * 'iType' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'iMediaConnectFlows' - A list of MediaConnect Flows for this input.
--
-- * 'iInputSourceType' - Certain pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that they can have their URL's dynamically changes during input switch actions. Presently, this functionality only works with MP4_FILE inputs.
--
-- * 'iTags' - A collection of key-value pairs.
--
-- * 'iRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role this input assumes during and after creation.
