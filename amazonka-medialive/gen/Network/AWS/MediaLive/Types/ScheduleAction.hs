-- | Creates a value of 'ScheduleAction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'saActionName' - The name of the action, must be unique within the schedule. This name provides the main reference to an action once it is added to the schedule. A name is unique if it is no longer in the schedule. The schedule is automatically cleaned up to remove actions with a start time of more than 1 hour ago (approximately) so at that point a name can be reused.
--
-- * 'saScheduleActionStartSettings' - The time for the action to start in the channel.
--
-- * 'saScheduleActionSettings' - Settings for this schedule action.
