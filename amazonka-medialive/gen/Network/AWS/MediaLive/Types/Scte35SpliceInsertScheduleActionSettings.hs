-- | Creates a value of 'Scte35SpliceInsertScheduleActionSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssisasDuration' - Optional, the duration for the splice_insert, in 90 KHz ticks. To convert seconds to ticks, multiple the seconds by 90,000. If you enter a duration, there is an expectation that the downstream system can read the duration and cue in at that time. If you do not enter a duration, the splice_insert will continue indefinitely and there is an expectation that you will enter a return_to_network to end the splice_insert at the appropriate time.
--
-- * 'ssisasSpliceEventId' - The splice_event_id for the SCTE-35 splice_insert, as defined in SCTE-35.
