-- | Creates a value of 'HlsBasicPutSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hbpsNumRetries' - Number of retry attempts that will be made before the Live Event is put into an error state.
--
-- * 'hbpsConnectionRetryInterval' - Number of seconds to wait before retrying connection to the CDN if the connection is lost.
--
-- * 'hbpsFilecacheDuration' - Size in seconds of file cache for streaming outputs.
--
-- * 'hbpsRestartDelay' - If a streaming output fails, number of seconds to wait until a restart is initiated. A value of 0 means never restart.
