-- | Creates a value of 'HlsInputSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hisBufferSegments' - When specified, reading of the HLS input will begin this many buffer segments from the end (most recently written segment).  When not specified, the HLS input will begin with the first segment specified in the m3u8.
--
-- * 'hisRetries' - The number of consecutive times that attempts to read a manifest or segment must fail before the input is considered unavailable.
--
-- * 'hisRetryInterval' - The number of seconds between retries when an attempt to read a manifest or segment fails.
--
-- * 'hisBandwidth' - When specified the HLS stream with the m3u8 BANDWIDTH that most closely matches this value will be chosen, otherwise the highest bandwidth stream in the m3u8 will be chosen.  The bitrate is specified in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest.
