-- | Creates a value of 'AudioLanguageSelection' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'alsLanguageSelectionPolicy' - When set to "strict", the transport stream demux strictly identifies audio streams by their language descriptor. If a PMT update occurs such that an audio stream matching the initially selected language is no longer present then mute will be encoded until the language returns. If "loose", then on a PMT update the demux will choose another audio stream in the program with the same stream type if it can't find one with the same language.
--
-- * 'alsLanguageCode' - Selects a specific three-letter language code from within an audio source.
