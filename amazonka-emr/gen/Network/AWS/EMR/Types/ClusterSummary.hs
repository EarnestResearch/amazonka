-- | Creates a value of 'ClusterSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'csStatus' - The details about the current status of the cluster.
--
-- * 'csNormalizedInstanceHours' - An approximation of the cost of the cluster, represented in m1.small/hours. This value is incremented one time for every hour an m1.small instance runs. Larger instances are weighted more, so an EC2 instance that is roughly four times more expensive would result in the normalized instance hours being incremented by four. This result is only an approximation and does not reflect the actual billing rate.
--
-- * 'csName' - The name of the cluster.
--
-- * 'csId' - The unique identifier for the cluster.
