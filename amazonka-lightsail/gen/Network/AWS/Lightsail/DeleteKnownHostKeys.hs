-- Deletes the known host key or certificate used by the Amazon Lightsail browser-based SSH or RDP clients to authenticate an instance. This operation enables the Lightsail browser-based SSH or RDP clients to connect to the instance after a host key mismatch.
--
--
-- /Important:/ Perform this operation only if you were expecting the host key or certificate mismatch or if you are familiar with the new host key or certificate on the instance. For more information, see <https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-troubleshooting-browser-based-ssh-rdp-client-connection Troubleshooting connection issues when using the Amazon Lightsail browser-based SSH or RDP client> .
