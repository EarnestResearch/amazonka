-- | Creates a value of 'LoadBalancer' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lbHealthCheckPath' - The path you specified to perform your health checks. If no path is specified, the load balancer tries to make a request to the default (root) page.
--
-- * 'lbState' - The status of your load balancer. Valid values are below.
--
-- * 'lbResourceType' - The resource type (e.g., @LoadBalancer@ .
--
-- * 'lbArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.
--
-- * 'lbCreatedAt' - The date when your load balancer was created.
--
-- * 'lbLocation' - The AWS Region where your load balancer was created (e.g., @us-east-2a@ ). Lightsail automatically creates your load balancer across Availability Zones.
--
-- * 'lbInstancePort' - The port where the load balancer will direct traffic to your Lightsail instances. For HTTP traffic, it's port 80. For HTTPS traffic, it's port 443.
--
-- * 'lbConfigurationOptions' - A string to string map of the configuration options for your load balancer. Valid values are listed below.
--
-- * 'lbProtocol' - The protocol you have enabled for your load balancer. Valid values are below. You can't just have @HTTP_HTTPS@ , but you can have just @HTTP@ .
--
-- * 'lbTlsCertificateSummaries' - An array of LoadBalancerTlsCertificateSummary objects that provide additional information about the SSL/TLS certificates. For example, if @true@ , the certificate is attached to the load balancer.
--
-- * 'lbName' - The name of the load balancer (e.g., @my-load-balancer@ ).
--
-- * 'lbSupportCode' - The support code. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about your Lightsail load balancer. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
--
-- * 'lbPublicPorts' - An array of public port settings for your load balancer. For HTTP, use port 80. For HTTPS, use port 443.
--
-- * 'lbDnsName' - The DNS name of your Lightsail load balancer.
--
-- * 'lbInstanceHealthSummary' - An array of InstanceHealthSummary objects describing the health of the load balancer.
