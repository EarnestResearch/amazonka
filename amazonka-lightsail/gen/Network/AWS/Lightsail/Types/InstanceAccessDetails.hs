-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceAccessDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iadCertKey' - For SSH access, the public key to use when accessing your instance For OpenSSH clients (e.g., command line SSH), you should save this value to @tempkey-cert.pub@ .
--
-- * 'iadIpAddress' - The public IP address of the Amazon Lightsail instance.
--
-- * 'iadPrivateKey' - For SSH access, the temporary private key. For OpenSSH clients (e.g., command line SSH), you should save this value to @tempkey@ ).
--
-- * 'iadExpiresAt' - For SSH access, the date on which the temporary keys expire.
--
-- * 'iadUsername' - The user name to use when logging in to the Amazon Lightsail instance.
--
-- * 'iadProtocol' - The protocol for these Amazon Lightsail instance access details.
--
-- * 'iadPasswordData' - For a Windows Server-based instance, an object with the data you can use to retrieve your password. This is only needed if @password@ is empty and the instance is not new (and therefore the password is not ready yet). When you create an instance, it can take up to 15 minutes for the instance to be ready.
--
-- * 'iadPassword' - For RDP access, the password for your Amazon Lightsail instance. Password will be an empty string if the password for your new instance is not ready yet. When you create an instance, it can take up to 15 minutes for the instance to be ready.
--
-- * 'iadInstanceName' - The name of this Amazon Lightsail instance.
