-- | Creates a value of 'Instance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iState' - The status code and the state (e.g., @running@ ) for the instance.
--
-- * 'iIpv6Address' - The IPv6 address of the instance.
--
-- * 'iResourceType' - The type of resource (usually @Instance@ ).
--
-- * 'iArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance (e.g., @arn:aws:lightsail:us-east-2:123456789101:Instance/244ad76f-8aad-4741-809f-12345EXAMPLE@ ).
--
-- * 'iCreatedAt' - The timestamp when the instance was created (e.g., @1479734909.17@ ).
--
-- * 'iLocation' - The region name and Availability Zone where the instance is located.
--
-- * 'iSshKeyName' - The name of the SSH key being used to connect to the instance (e.g., @LightsailDefaultKeyPair@ ).
--
-- * 'iAddOns' - An array of objects representing the add-ons enabled on the instance.
--
-- * 'iUsername' - The user name for connecting to the instance (e.g., @ec2-user@ ).
--
-- * 'iNetworking' - Information about the public ports and monthly data transfer rates for the instance.
--
-- * 'iBundleId' - The bundle for the instance (e.g., @micro_1_0@ ).
--
-- * 'iName' - The name the user gave the instance (e.g., @Amazon_Linux-1GB-Ohio-1@ ).
--
-- * 'iSupportCode' - The support code. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about an instance or another resource in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
--
-- * 'iBlueprintId' - The blueprint ID (e.g., @os_amlinux_2016_03@ ).
--
-- * 'iPrivateIPAddress' - The private IP address of the instance.
--
-- * 'iBlueprintName' - The friendly name of the blueprint (e.g., @Amazon Linux@ ).
--
-- * 'iIsStaticIP' - A Boolean value indicating whether this instance has a static IP assigned to it.
