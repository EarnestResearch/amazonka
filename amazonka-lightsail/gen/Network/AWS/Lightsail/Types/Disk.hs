-- | Creates a value of 'Disk' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dState' - Describes the status of the disk.
--
-- * 'dResourceType' - The Lightsail resource type (e.g., @Disk@ ).
--
-- * 'dArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the disk.
--
-- * 'dPath' - The disk path.
--
-- * 'dCreatedAt' - The date when the disk was created.
--
-- * 'dLocation' - The AWS Region and Availability Zone where the disk is located.
--
-- * 'dIops' - The input/output operations per second (IOPS) of the disk.
--
-- * 'dIsAttached' - A Boolean value indicating whether the disk is attached.
--
-- * 'dAttachmentState' - (Deprecated) The attachment state of the disk.
--
-- * 'dName' - The unique name of the disk.
--
-- * 'dSizeInGb' - The size of the disk in GB.
--
-- * 'dSupportCode' - The support code. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about an instance or another resource in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
--
-- * 'dIsSystemDisk' - A Boolean value indicating whether this disk is a system disk (has an operating system loaded on it).
--
-- * 'dAttachedTo' - The resources to which the disk is attached.
--
-- * 'dGbInUse' - (Deprecated) The number of GB in use by the disk.
