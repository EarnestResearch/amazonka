-- | Creates a value of 'ContactMethod' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmStatus' - The current status of the contact method. A contact method has the following possible status:     * @PendingVerification@ — The contact method has not yet been verified, and the verification has not yet expired.     * @Valid@ — The contact method has been verified.     * @InValid@ — An attempt was made to verify the contact method, but the verification has expired.
--
-- * 'cmResourceType' - The Lightsail resource type (e.g., @ContactMethod@ ).
--
-- * 'cmArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact method.
--
-- * 'cmCreatedAt' - The timestamp when the contact method was created.
--
-- * 'cmLocation' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'cmProtocol' - The protocol of the contact method, such as email or SMS (text messaging).
--
-- * 'cmName' - The name of the contact method.
--
-- * 'cmSupportCode' - The support code. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about your Lightsail contact method. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
--
-- * 'cmContactEndpoint' - The destination of the contact method, such as an email address or a mobile phone number.
