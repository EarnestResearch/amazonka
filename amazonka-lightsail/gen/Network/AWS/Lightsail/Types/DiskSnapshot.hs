-- | Creates a value of 'DiskSnapshot' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dsFromDiskName' - The unique name of the source disk from which the disk snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsIsFromAutoSnapshot' - A Boolean value indicating whether the snapshot was created from an automatic snapshot.
--
-- * 'dsState' - The status of the disk snapshot operation.
--
-- * 'dsResourceType' - The Lightsail resource type (e.g., @DiskSnapshot@ ).
--
-- * 'dsArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the disk snapshot.
--
-- * 'dsCreatedAt' - The date when the disk snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsLocation' - The AWS Region and Availability Zone where the disk snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsProgress' - The progress of the disk snapshot operation.
--
-- * 'dsName' - The name of the disk snapshot (e.g., @my-disk-snapshot@ ).
--
-- * 'dsSizeInGb' - The size of the disk in GB.
--
-- * 'dsSupportCode' - The support code. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about an instance or another resource in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.
--
-- * 'dsFromInstanceARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source instance from which the disk (system volume) snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsFromInstanceName' - The unique name of the source instance from which the disk (system volume) snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsFromDiskARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source disk from which the disk snapshot was created.
--
-- * 'dsTags' - The tag keys and optional values for the resource. For more information about tags in Lightsail, see the <https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-tags Lightsail Dev Guide> .
