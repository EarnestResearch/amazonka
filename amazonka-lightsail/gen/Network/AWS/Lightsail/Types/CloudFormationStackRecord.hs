-- * 'cfsrCreatedAt' - The date when the CloudFormation stack record was created.
--
-- * 'cfsrLocation' - A list of objects describing the Availability Zone and AWS Region of the CloudFormation stack record.
--
-- * 'cfsrName' - The name of the CloudFormation stack record. It starts with @CloudFormationStackRecord@ followed by a GUID.
